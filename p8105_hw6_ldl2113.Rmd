## Problem 1

Read in and clean birthweight data for regression.

```{r}
birthweight_data = read_csv(file = "./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex, levels =  c("1", "2"), labels = c("male", "female")),
    frace = factor(frace, levels =  c("1", "2", "3", "4", "8", "9"), labels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other", "unknown")),
    malform = factor(malform, levels =  c("0", "1"), labels = c("absent", "present")),
    mrace = factor(mrace, levels =  c("1", "2", "3", "4", "8"), labels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other"))     
      )
birthweight_data
```

```{r}
sum(!complete.cases(birthweight_data))
```
