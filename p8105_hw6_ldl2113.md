## Problem 1

Read in and clean birthweight data for regression. Create dichotomous
maternal race variable for regression (black vs.Â non-black/unknown).

``` r
birthweight_data = read_csv(file = "./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex, levels =  c("1", "2"), labels = c("male", "female")),
    frace = factor(frace, levels =  c("1", "2", "3", "4", "8", "9"), labels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other", "unknown")),
    malform = factor(malform, levels =  c("0", "1"), labels = c("absent", "present")),
    mrace = factor(mrace, levels =  c("1", "2", "3", "4", "8"), labels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other"))
  ) %>%
  mutate(mblack = ifelse(mrace == "black", "true", "false"))
birthweight_data
```

*There are no missing data*

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process.

*Based on my clinical in the delivery room and NICU, I propose that
birthweight is modeled by the following factors: gestationl age, length,
head circumference, smoking status, income, and the number of prior low
birthweight babies born to the mother. I will also include maternal race
(black/non-black) given recent NYtimes coverage of the healthcare
disparities impacting black mothers and their babies even after other
factors such as SES are accounted for*

``` r
bwtmodel_1 = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + bhead + blength + smoken + fincome + pnumlbw, data = birthweight_data)

Create comparison models: One using length at birth and gestational age
as predictors (main effects only) and one using head circumference,
length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction)
between these.

``` r
bwtmodel_2 = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + blength, data = birthweight_data) 
bwtmodel_3 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex + bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight_data)
```

Make a comparison of these two models with your model in terms of the
cross-validated prediction error.

  - Based on RMSE, the model I developed (bwtmodel\_1) appears to be the
    best fit for the data, and in addition contains a moderate amount of
    complexity compared with models 2 (too simple) and 3 (too complex
    with interaction terms).\*
